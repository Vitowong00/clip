## Why you need to invest  

为什么需要投资

Why you need to invest Investing is perhaps the surest way to become wealthy. Here's a hint, it isn't asking for a raise. In fact, for the top 1%, the millionaires and above, salaries account for as little as 15% of their income. While a higher salary certainly helps in the short term, to really build wealth, you need to invest.  

为什么需要投资 投资也许是致富的最可靠途径。这里有一个提示，它不是要求加薪。事实上，对于收入最高的 1%，即百万富翁及以上的人来说，工资只占他们收入的 15%。虽然高薪在短期内肯定有帮助，但要真正积累财富，你需要进行投资。

Consider inflation. Over the past four decades, inflation has eroded the value of money at around 3% annually in the United States. Meanwhile, the S&P 500 index, which represents the 500 largest publicly traded US companies, has yielded an average annual positive return of more than 11%. This means if you stuck $1,000 under the proverbial mattress in 1980, by 2022 it would have dwindled to a mere $240 in value. On the other hand, if you'd invested it in the S&P 500, that same cool grand would have grown to nearly $30,000 in value. Author Darius Faroo argues that the formula for growing your wealth is simple.  

考虑通货膨胀。在过去的 40 年里，美国的通货膨胀率以每年约 3% 的速度侵蚀着货币的价值。与此同时，代表美国 500 家最大上市公司的标准普尔 500 指数的年均正收益率超过 11%。这意味着，如果你在 1980 年把 1000 美元放在众所周知的床垫下，到 2022 年，它的价值将缩水到仅剩 240 美元。另一方面，如果你把这笔钱投资到标准普尔 500 指数，那么这笔钱的价值将增长到近 3 万美元。作者达柳斯-法鲁认为，财富增长的公式很简单。

Invest it in reliable assets and keep it there. But simple doesn't mean easy. Pulling this off can be more challenging than it sounds. Why? There are three reasons. The first is volatility.  

把钱投资在可靠的资产上，并一直放在那里。但简单并不意味着容易。要做到这一点可能比听起来更具挑战性。为什么呢？原因有三。首先是波动性。

In the decades since 1980, we've seen wars, earthquakes, recessions, booms, crashes and even pandemics. Regardless of the market's gradual upward trend, this volatility triggers two powerful emotional responses – fear and greed. When prices plummet, fear drives people to sell at a loss. And when the market shoots up, greed tempts them to pour all their savings into the market at once. The second challenge is consistency. Today's vast array of investment options can be overwhelming, leading many investors to frequently switch up strategies and chase the latest trends.  

自 1980 年以来的几十年间，我们经历了战争、地震、经济衰退、繁荣、崩溃，甚至大流行病。无论市场的趋势如何逐步上升，这种波动都会引发两种强烈的情绪反应--恐惧和贪婪。当价格暴跌时，恐惧会驱使人们亏本抛售。而当市场暴涨时，贪婪又会诱使他们一下子把所有积蓄都投入市场。第二个挑战是一致性。当今投资选择繁多，让人应接不暇，导致许多投资者频繁更换策略，追逐最新趋势。

But successful investing often boils down to filtering out the noise and adhering to a proven investment strategy year after year. What if you don't have an investment strategy? What Faroo reckons to his own friends and family is an exchange-traded fund, ETF, that tracks, once again, the S&P 500. It takes minimal time and effort to execute and it performs well.  

但是，成功的投资往往归结为过滤噪音，年复一年地坚持行之有效的投资策略。如果没有投资策略怎么办？法鲁向自己的亲朋好友推荐的是一种交易所交易基金（ETF），再次追踪标准普尔500指数。它只需花费最少的时间和精力来执行，而且表现出色。

At an 11% interest rate, for instance, your investment will double roughly every seven years thanks to compounding. But to succeed in this, or any strategy, you've got to keep your cool on the market rollercoaster year after year. You have to stay strong and resist the burning temptation to abandon ship when faced with glittering opportunities, looming threats, or great loss. As we'll see in the next section.  

以 11% 的利率为例，通过复利计算，您的投资大约每七年就会翻一番。但是，要想在这一策略或任何策略中取得成功，你必须在年复一年的市场过山车中保持冷静。面对闪耀的机遇、迫在眉睫的威胁或巨大的损失时，你必须保持坚强，抵制弃船而去的强烈诱惑。我们将在下一节中看到这一点。

## A personal loss 个人的损失

A personal loss Darius Faroo was born in Iran in 1987, during the country's devastating war with Iraq. Faroo's parents emigrated to the Netherlands, arriving with nothing but a couple of suitcases. They had lost everything and had to start over from scratch. Growing up, Faroo recalls there was never enough money.  

个人的损失 达里乌斯-法鲁于 1987 年出生在伊朗，当时正值伊朗与伊拉克发生毁灭性战争。法鲁的父母移民到荷兰，当时他们除了几个手提箱外一无所有。他们失去了一切，不得不从头开始。法鲁回忆说，在他的成长过程中，钱总是不够用。

So from a young age he promised himself he'd do whatever it took to become wealthy someday. Faroo studied business and finance in college. As soon as he could, he started investing with the amount he could scrape together – about $2,000. But misfortune struck. As it happens, he'd started his investing career at the very peak of the 2008 housing bubble. The markets crashed and he lost over half of his money.  

因此，他从小就向自己保证，有朝一日一定要不惜一切代价致富。法鲁在大学里学习商业和金融。一有机会，他就开始用自己能凑到的钱进行投资--大约 2000 美元。但不幸还是降临了。碰巧的是，他是在 2008 年房地产泡沫最严重的时候开始投资生涯的。市场崩溃，他损失了一半以上的资金。

Losing money on the stock market isn't uncommon. Research indicates that only between 1 and 3% of active individual investors actually achieve short-term profits. But after experiencing losses, many people become disillusioned with investing and start thinking it's only for those other people. Faroo hadn't let go of his dream. He immersed himself in research, searching for the secrets of master investors and the perfect investment strategy. But the money he'd lost left him too afraid to pull the trigger and put anything real at stake.  

在股市上亏损并不罕见。研究表明，只有 1% 到 3% 的活跃个人投资者真正实现了短期盈利。但在经历了亏损之后，许多人对投资产生了幻灭感，开始认为投资只是那些其他人的事。法鲁没有放弃他的梦想。他潜心研究，寻找投资大师的秘诀和完美的投资策略。但他失去的钱让他不敢扣动扳机，不敢把任何东西真正置于危险之中。

It wasn't until he came across a passage from the Stoic philosopher Seneca that he truly understood his situation. Every emotion is weak at first, then it rouses itself and gathers strength as it advances. And when you indulge in it too much, it is a fault. Faroo had let his fear of investing grow and grow, gathering strength in the years since his painful loss. To take the next step in becoming wealthy, he didn't need more knowledge. He needed to master his emotions.  

直到他看到斯多葛派哲学家塞内加的一段话，才真正明白了自己的处境。每种情绪起初都很微弱，但随着时间的推移，它会逐渐唤醒自己并积蓄力量。当你过于沉溺于它时，它就是一种过错。法鲁对投资的恐惧与日俱增，在他痛失亲人后的这些年里不断积蓄力量。为了迈出致富的下一步，他不需要更多的知识。他需要掌握自己的情绪。

## A Stoicism primer 斯多葛主义入门

A Stoicism Primer The Stoics were a diverse group of ancient Greek and Roman philosophers who flourished from the 3rd century BCE to the 3rd century CE. Key figures include Seneca, a Roman statesman and playwright, Epictetus, a former slave turned teacher, and Marcus Aurelius, the philosopher-emperor of Rome. But Stoicism was actually founded by a merchant by the name of Zeno of Citium. One day, while transporting goods on a sea voyage, Zeno's vessel was shipwrecked, causing him to lose a fortune and seek the consolations of philosophy.  

斯多葛学派入门斯多葛学派是一个由古希腊和古罗马哲学家组成的多元化团体，兴盛于公元前 3 世纪至公元前 3 世纪。主要人物包括罗马政治家和剧作家塞内加（Seneca）、由奴隶转变为教师的伊壁鸠鲁（Epictetus）以及罗马哲学家皇帝马库斯-奥勒留（Marcus Aurelius）。但斯多葛学派实际上是由一位名叫芝诺的西提姆商人创立的。有一天，芝诺的船只在海上运输货物时遭遇海难，导致他倾家荡产，并寻求哲学的安慰。

It was a bitter pill to swallow, but what Zeno realised was that misfortune can strike anyone. Stoicism teaches that the path to happiness and fulfilment lies in focusing on what's within our power to change, and accepting with grace all that we can't. So much in life lies beyond our control. We can't always shape the world into what we'd like it to be, but we can control our character, our judgement, and the actions we take. The Stoic approach to life is encapsulated by a phrase attributed to Zeno – virtue is the only good. Ultimately, the good and bad things that happen in life – health and illness, wealth and poverty, pleasure and pain – are merely, to quote Marcus Aurelius, material for virtue to act upon.  

这是一剂难以下咽的苦药，但芝诺意识到，任何人都可能遭遇不幸。斯多葛主义告诉我们，通往幸福和成就的道路在于专注于我们有能力改变的事情，并优雅地接受我们无法改变的一切。生活中有很多事情是我们无法控制的。我们不能总是把世界塑造成我们希望的样子，但我们可以控制自己的性格、判断力和所采取的行动。芝诺的一句话概括了斯多葛派的生活态度--美德是唯一的善。归根结底，生活中发生的好事和坏事--健康和疾病、财富和贫穷、快乐和痛苦--引用马库斯-奥勒留的话说，只不过是美德发挥作用的材料。

In honing the virtues of wisdom, justice, courage and self-control, we build the strength to navigate life's challenges more happily. A true Stoic, says Epictetus, may be sick and yet happy, in peril and yet happy, dying and yet happy, in exile and happy, in disgrace and happy. Going too far, our desires can become obstacles. Think about how we build our lives around specific milestones and external goals, or plan our investing around exact income targets and figures.  

在磨练智慧、正义、勇气和自我控制等美德的过程中，我们会积蓄力量，更快乐地应对生活中的挑战。伊壁鸠鲁说，一个真正的斯多葛主义者可能生病却快乐，身处险境却快乐，濒临死亡却快乐，流亡却快乐，蒙受耻辱却快乐。走得太远，我们的欲望会成为障碍。想想我们是如何围绕着具体的里程碑和外部目标来打造自己的生活，或者围绕着精确的收入目标和数字来规划我们的投资。

But all of these lie, at least to some extent, beyond what we can control directly. The Stoic solution isn't to eliminate desire, but to redirect it. Instead of fixating on outcomes, we should cultivate desire for our own virtues and personal growth. These goals are always within reach.  

但所有这些，至少在某种程度上，都超出了我们能够直接控制的范围。斯多葛派的解决方案不是消除欲望，而是重新引导它。我们不应执着于结果，而应培养对自身美德和个人成长的渴望。这些目标总是触手可及的。

## Skill and self-reliance 技能与自立

Skill and self-reliance So the Stoics urge us to focus on what we can most directly control – our own virtue. But that's not all. We can also cultivate our skills and knowledge. How does this apply to investing?  

技能和自力更生 所以斯多葛学派敦促我们关注我们能最直接控制的东西--我们自己的美德。但这还不是全部。我们还可以培养自己的技能和知识。这如何适用于投资呢？

Well, to invest, you need some initial capital. For anyone not born into wealth, that means developing a skill others will pay for. By continually sharpening your abilities and expanding your knowledge, you lay a solid foundation you can rely on no matter what. Consider the story of Jesse Livermore, a high school dropout who became one of the most successful traders of the early 20th century. Starting as a board boy at a brokerage firm, he absorbed knowledge voraciously, developing a system for predicting stock movements with remarkable accuracy. Those around him couldn't help but notice his skills, and so helped him recover his wealth even after multiple bankruptcies.  

要投资，你需要一些初始资本。对于任何并非生来富有的人来说，这就意味着要培养一种别人愿意为之付出代价的技能。通过不断磨练自己的能力和扩大自己的知识面，你就能打下坚实的基础，无论遇到什么情况，你都可以依靠它。请看杰西-利弗莫尔的故事，这位高中辍学生成为了 20 世纪初最成功的交易员之一。他从一家经纪公司的板童做起，贪婪地吸收知识，开发出一套预测股票走势的系统，准确率非常高。他周围的人不禁注意到了他的技能，因此在他多次破产后仍帮助他恢复了财富。

Eventually, his skills led him to amass a fortune during the 1929 stock market crash. Livermore's story underscores a crucial Stoic principle – resilience through self-reliance. While money can be lost in market downturns, skills remain a permanent asset. Farouk calls his framework for developing skills the Skill Springboard. First, identify and nurture your inherent strengths and passions. Then study the greatest people in your chosen field and master the fundamentals.  

最终，他的技能使他在 1929 年股市崩盘时积累了一笔财富。利弗莫尔的故事强调了斯多葛学派的一个重要原则--自力更生，坚韧不拔。在市场低迷时，金钱可能会流失，而技能则是永久的资产。法鲁克将他的技能发展框架称为 "技能跳板"。首先，确定并培养自己与生俱来的优势和激情。然后，学习你所选择领域中最伟大的人物，掌握基础知识。

Next, it's time to synthesize that knowledge into your own distinctive style. And finally, be sure to balance your determined effort with sufficient rest. You want to achieve excellence, but not at the risk of burnout. This approach to skill development also requires consistent self-reflection.  

然后，将这些知识综合成自己的独特风格。最后，一定要在坚定的努力和充分的休息之间取得平衡。你要追求卓越，但又不能冒倦怠的风险。这种技能培养方法还需要坚持不懈的自我反思。

The journaling, a practice advocated by many Stoics, can help you identify your natural abilities and track your progress. And as an investor, self-awareness and reflection will help you deepen your financial knowledge and refine your investment strategies. By focusing on continuous learning and improvement, you won't just build wealth – you'll cultivate financial wisdom and freedom. After all, as Epictetus put it, only the educated are free.  

写日记是许多斯多葛学派倡导的一种做法，它可以帮助你发现自己的天赋能力并跟踪自己的进步。而作为一名投资者，自我认识和反思将帮助你深化金融知识，完善投资策略。专注于不断学习和进步，你不仅能积累财富，还能培养财务智慧和自由。毕竟，正如伊壁鸠鲁所说，只有受过教育的人才能获得自由。

## Moderate your desires 节制欲望

Moderate your desires. All too often, greed lies at the heart of investing mistakes. The relentless pursuit of more – more money, more returns, more status – can lead to destructive behaviour and poor decision-making. It's easy to fall into the trap of chasing the quick buck.  

节制欲望。贪婪往往是投资失误的核心。不懈地追求更多--更多的金钱、更多的回报、更高的地位--会导致破坏性的行为和错误的决策。我们很容易掉进追逐快钱的陷阱。

But one of the most crucial lessons in investing is that wealth builds faster when you focus on avoiding losses rather than pursuing the highest possible returns. In the long term, the key to success is protecting your capital. Think of your investment portfolio as a garden. While it's important to nurture and grow your plants, it's equally vital to protect them from pests and harsh weather. One bad storm can undo months of careful tending. In the same way, you should focus on sticking to your investment strategy, managing risks and educating yourself rather than trying to predict the next big winner.  

但投资中最关键的一课是，当你专注于避免损失而不是追求最高回报时，财富积累的速度会更快。从长远来看，成功的关键在于保护你的资本。把你的投资组合想象成一个花园。培育和种植植物固然重要，但保护它们不受虫害和恶劣天气的影响也同样重要。一场恶劣的暴风雨就能让数月的精心照料付诸东流。同样，您应该专注于坚持自己的投资策略、管理风险和自我教育，而不是试图预测下一个大赢家。

To help control emotions like greed and fear, here's an exercise you can try. Take a burning desire that you have – like, I need to generate 20% returns this year. Now see how you can reframe that in terms of what's truly within your power. For instance, you could say, I'll focus on making well-researched investment decisions based on my long-term strategy. This reframing acknowledges the reality of uncertainty while emphasising your agency in the process. By aligning your desires with what you can control, you'll learn to find satisfaction in the quality of your efforts rather than the vagaries of outcomes.  

为了帮助控制贪婪和恐惧等情绪，你可以尝试以下练习。假设你有一个迫切的愿望--比如，我今年需要获得 20% 的回报。现在，看看你如何根据自己的能力来重塑这个愿望。比如，你可以说，我将专注于根据我的长期战略做出经过充分研究的投资决策。这种重构既承认了不确定性的现实，又强调了你在这一过程中的能动性。通过将你的愿望与你能够控制的事情结合起来，你将学会从你努力的质量中找到满足感，而不是从变化无常的结果中。

Another valuable stoic practice is moderating your habits, starting with something as fundamental as food. By exercising self-control in your daily life – like putting down your fork when you're full – you'll build the mental muscle needed to resist impulsive urges in other areas, including your financial decisions. This practice of moderation extends to your approach to wealth itself. Rather than constantly striving for more, aim for enough. What does enough signify in the context of investing? It means finding a balance where your financial needs are met and you have a cushion for the future without the constant pressure to endlessly accumulate more money.  

另一种有价值的委曲求全的做法是节制自己的习惯，从食物这样最基本的东西开始。通过在日常生活中实行自我控制--比如吃饱了就放下叉子--你就能在其他方面（包括财务决策）建立起抵制冲动所需的精神力量。这种节制的做法也适用于你对待财富的态度本身。与其不断追求更多，不如追求足够。在投资方面，"足够 "意味着什么？这意味着要找到一个平衡点，既能满足你的财务需求，又能为未来留出缓冲空间，而不会持续承受无休止地积累更多资金的压力。

Legendary investor Jack Bogle, founder of the Vanguard Group, embodied this principle. Despite creating a trillion-dollar investment company, Bogle lived relatively modestly and focused on providing value to investors rather than maximising his personal wealth. He defined enough as having one dollar more than you need. Adopting this mindset doesn't mean settling for mediocrity or giving up on wealth. Instead, it allows you to approach investing with a clear head, making decisions based on sound principles rather than emotional impulses or societal pressures.  

传奇投资者、先锋集团（Vanguard Group）创始人杰克-博格尔（Jack Bogle）就体现了这一原则。尽管创建了一家市值万亿美元的投资公司，博格尔的生活却相对俭朴，他专注于为投资者提供价值，而不是最大限度地增加个人财富。他将 "足够 "定义为比你需要的多一块钱。采用这种心态并不意味着甘于平庸或放弃财富。相反，它能让你以清醒的头脑对待投资，根据合理的原则而不是情感冲动或社会压力做出决定。

#### Conclusion 结论

## Final summary 最后总结

The main takeaway of this blink to The Stoic Path to Wealth by Darius Faroo is that successful investing takes more than just financial knowledge. It takes mastering your emotions. That's because building wealth is a marathon, not a sprint. The surest path is to consistently invest in reliable assets such as index funds tracking the S&P 500.  

从达里乌斯-法鲁（Darius Faroo）的《斯多葛财富之路》（The Stoic Path to Wealth）一书中得到的主要启示是，成功的投资需要的不仅仅是金融知识。它需要掌握自己的情绪。这是因为积累财富是一场马拉松，而不是短跑。最可靠的途径是持续投资于可靠的资产，如跟踪标准普尔 500 指数的指数基金。

But the challenges of market volatility, maintaining consistency and dealing with losses can still derail all but the most level-headed investors. Stoicism calls you to develop the virtues of wisdom, justice, courage and self-control so you can face these challenges calmly. This begins with a subtle but powerful shift in your internal dialogue to reframe your desires in terms of what's truly in your power. In other words, focus on what you can control and accept what you can't. It's also important to practice moderation in your daily life which will help you build a strong stoic foundation. By embracing these stoic principles, you'll cultivate a mindset that leads to greater contentment because, in the end, true wealth isn't just about having lots of money.  

但是，除了最冷静的投资者，市场波动、保持一致性和应对亏损等挑战仍然会让所有投资者迷失方向。斯多葛主义要求你培养智慧、正义、勇气和自我控制的美德，这样你才能冷静地面对这些挑战。这首先要在你的内心对话中进行微妙而有力的转变，以你真正有能力做到的事情来重塑你的愿望。换句话说，关注你能控制的，接受你不能控制的。在日常生活中保持适度也很重要，这将帮助你打下坚实的委曲求全的基础。通过接受这些委曲求全的原则，你将培养一种心态，从而获得更多的满足感，因为归根结底，真正的财富并不仅仅是拥有很多钱。
