_This post is crossposted from my Substack. Original_ [_here_](https://nosetgauge.substack.com/p/capital-agi-and-human-ambition).  

本帖从我的 Substack 中交叉发布。原文在此。

**Edited to add**_**:** The main takeaway of this post is meant to be: **Labour-replacing AI will shift the relative importance of human v non-human factors of production, which reduces the incentives for society to care about humans while making existing powers more effective and entrenched.** Many people are reading this post in a way where either (a) "capital" means just "money" (rather than also including physical capital like factories and data centres), or (b) the main concern is human-human inequality (rather than broader societal concerns about humanity's collective position, the potential for social change, and human agency)._  

编辑补充：这篇文章的主要观点是：取代劳动力的人工智能将改变人类与非人类生产要素的相对重要性，从而降低社会关注人类的动力，同时使现有权力更加有效和稳固。许多人在阅读这篇文章时，要么（a）"资本 "仅仅指 "金钱"（而不是也包括工厂和数据中心等物质资本），要么（b）主要关注的是人与人之间的不平等（而不是对人类集体地位、社会变革潜力和人类能动性的更广泛社会关注）。

I've heard many people say something like "money won't matter post-AGI". This has always struck me as odd, and as most likely completely incorrect.  

我听过很多人说过类似 "AGI 之后钱就不重要了 "这样的话。我一直觉得这种说法很奇怪，而且很可能是完全错误的。

First: labour means human mental and physical effort that produces something of value. Capital goods are things like factories, data centres, and software—things humans have built that are used in the production of goods and services. I'll use "capital" to refer to both the stock of capital goods and to the money that can pay for them. I'll say "money" when I want to exclude capital goods.  

首先：劳动是指人类付出脑力和体力劳动，生产出有价值的东西。资本货物是指工厂、数据中心和软件等人类建造的用于生产商品和服务的东西。我用 "资本 "来指资本货物的存量和可以支付它们的货币。当我想排除资本货物时，我会说 "货币"。

The key economic effect of AI is that it makes capital a more and more general substitute for labour. There's less need to pay humans for their time to perform work, because you can replace that with capital (e.g. data centres running software replaces a human doing mental labour).  

人工智能的主要经济效应是，它使资本越来越普遍地替代劳动力。因为你可以用资本来替代人类的工作（例如，运行软件的数据中心可以替代人类的脑力劳动），所以就不需要为人类的工作时间支付报酬了。

I will walk through consequences of this, and end up concluding that labour-replacing AI means:  

我将阐述其后果，最后得出结论：人工智能取代劳动力意味着

1.  The ability to buy results in the real world will dramatically go up  
    
    在现实世界中购买成果的能力将大幅提高
2.  Human ability to wield power in the real world will dramatically go down (at least without money); including because:  
    
    人类在现实世界中行使权力的能力将大幅下降（至少在没有金钱的情况下）；原因包括
    1.  there will be no more incentive for states, companies, or other institutions to care about humans  
        
        国家、公司或其他机构将不再有动力关心人类
    2.  it will be harder for humans to achieve outlier outcomes relative to their starting resources  
        
        相对于起始资源而言，人类将更难取得超常的结果
3.  Radical equalising measures are unlikely  
    
    不可能采取激进的平等措施

Overall, this points to a neglected downside of transformative AI: that society might become permanently static, and that current power imbalances might be amplified and then turned immutable.  

总体而言，这表明变革型人工智能存在一个被忽视的弊端：社会可能会变得永久静止，当前的权力不平衡可能会被放大，然后变得不可改变。

Given sufficiently strong AI, _this is not a risk about insufficient material comfort_. Governments could institute UBI with the AI-derived wealth. Even if e.g. only the United States captures AI wealth and the US government does nothing for the world, if you're willing to assume arbitrarily extreme wealth generation from AI, the wealth of the small percentage of wealthy Americans who care about causes outside the US might be enough to end material poverty (if 1% of American billionaire wealth was spent on wealth transfers to foreigners, it would take 16 doublings of American billionaire wealth as expressed in purchasing-power-for-human-needs—a roughly 70,000x increase—before they could afford to give $500k-equivalent to every person on Earth; in a singularity scenario where the economy's doubling time is months, this would not take long). Of course, if the AI explosion is less singularity-like, or if the dynamics during AI take-off actively disempower much of the world's population (a real possibility), even material comfort could be an issue.  

如果人工智能足够强大，这就不是物质生活不够舒适的风险。政府可以利用人工智能带来的财富建立全民消费补贴制度。即使例如只有美国获得了人工智能财富，而美国政府没有为世界做任何事情，如果你愿意任意假设人工智能创造了极端的财富，那么一小部分关心美国以外事业的美国富豪的财富可能足以结束物质贫困（如果美国亿万富翁财富的1%用于向外国人转移财富，那么以人类需求购买力表示的美国亿万富翁财富需要翻16倍--大约7万倍的增长--才有能力向地球上的每个人提供相当于50万美元的财富；在经济倍增时间为几个月的奇点情景中，这不会花很长时间）。当然，如果人工智能的爆炸没有那么奇异，或者如果人工智能起飞时的动力主动剥夺了世界上大部分人口的权力（这是一种真实的可能性），那么即使是物质上的舒适也会成为一个问题。

What most emotionally moves me about these scenarios is that a static society with a locked-in ruling caste does not seem dynamic or alive to me. We should not kill human ambition, if we can help it.  

在这些场景中，最让我感慨的是，在我看来，一个静态的、统治阶级被禁锢的社会是没有活力和生命力的。如果可以的话，我们不应该扼杀人类的野心。

There are also ways in which such a state makes [slow-rolling, gradual AI catastrophes](https://nosetgauge.substack.com/p/a-disneyland-without-children) more likely, because the incentive for power to care about humans is reduced.  

在某些方面，这种状态也更有可能导致缓慢滚动、渐进的人工智能灾难，因为权力关心人类的动力被削弱了。

## **The default solution  默认解决方案**

Let's assume human mental and physical labour across the vast majority of tasks that humans are currently paid wages for no longer has non-trivial market value, because the tasks can be done better/faster/cheaper by AIs. Call this labour-replacing AI.  

让我们假设，人类目前在绝大多数任务中付出的脑力和体力劳动不再具有非同小可的市场价值，因为人工智能可以更好、更快、更便宜地完成这些任务。这就是人工智能对劳动力的替代。

There are two levels of the standard solution to the resulting unemployment problem:  

解决由此产生的失业问题的标准方案分为两个层次：

1.  Governments will adopt something universal basic income (UBI).  
    
    政府将采取一些全民基本收入（UBI）措施。
2.  We will quickly hit superintelligence, and, assuming the superintelligence is aligned, live in a post-scarcity technological wonderland where everything is possible.  
    
    我们将迅速达到超级智能，并且，假设超级智能是一致的，我们将生活在一个后匮乏时代的技术仙境中，一切皆有可能。

Note, firstly, that money will continue being a thing, at least unless we have one single AI system doing all economic planning. [Prices are largely about communicating information](https://www.econlib.org/library/Essays/hykKnw.html). If there are many actors and they trade with each other, the strong assumption should be that there are prices (even if humans do not see them or interact with them). Remember too that however sharp the singularity, abundance will still be finite, and must therefore be allocated.  

首先要注意的是，货币将继续存在，至少除非我们有一个单一的人工智能系统来进行所有的经济规划。价格在很大程度上是一种信息沟通。如果有许多参与者，而且他们相互之间进行交易，那么一个强有力的假设就是存在价格（即使人类看不到它们或与它们互动）。还要记住的是，无论奇点有多尖锐，丰度仍然是有限的，因此必须进行分配。

## **Money currently struggles to buy talent  

目前，金钱难以买到人才**

Money can buy you many things: capital goods, for example, can usually be bought quite straightforwardly, and cannot be bought without a lot of money (or other liquid assets, or non-liquid assets that others are willing to write contracts against, or special government powers). But it is surprisingly hard to convert raw money into labour, in a way that is competitive with top labour.  

钱可以买到很多东西：比如，资本货物通常可以很直接地买到，没有大量的钱（或其他流动资产，或别人愿意签订合同的非流动资产，或政府的特殊权力）是买不到的。但要将原始资金转化为劳动力，并使其具有与顶级劳动力竞争的能力，却出乎意料地困难。

Consider Blue Origin versus SpaceX. Blue Origin was started two years earlier (2000 v 2002), had much better funding for most of its history, and even today employs almost as many people as SpaceX (11,000 v 13,000). Yet SpaceX has crushingly dominated Blue Origin. In 2000, Jeff Bezos had $4.7B at hand. But it is hard to see what he could've done to not lose out to the comparatively money-poor SpaceX with its intense culture and outlier talent.  

考虑一下 Blue Origin 与 SpaceX 的对比。蓝色起源公司比 SpaceX 早两年成立（2000 年对 2002 年），在其发展史上的大部分时间里都拥有更好的资金，即使在今天，其员工人数也几乎和 SpaceX 一样多（11,000 对 13,000）。然而，SpaceX 却以压倒性的优势领先于蓝色起源。2000 年，杰夫-贝索斯手头有 47 亿美元。但很难看出他能做什么，才能不输给资金相对匮乏、文化氛围浓厚、人才济济的 SpaceX。

Consider, a century earlier, the Wright brothers with their bike shop resources beating Samuel Langley's well-funded operation.  

想想一个世纪之前，莱特兄弟凭借自行车店的资源击败了塞缪尔-兰利资金雄厚的公司。

Consider the stereotypical VC-and-founder interaction, or the acquirer-and-startup interaction. In both cases, holders of massive financial capital are willing to pay very high prices to bet on labour—and the bet is that the labour of the few people in the startup will beat extremely large amounts of capital.  

考虑一下千篇一律的风险投资公司与创始人之间的互动，或者收购方与初创公司之间的互动。在这两种情况下，巨额金融资本的持有者都愿意出高价押注于劳动力--赌注是初创企业中少数人的劳动力将击败巨额资本。

If you want to convert money into results, the deepest problem you are likely to face is hiring the right talent. And that comes with several problems:  

如果你想将资金转化为成果，那么你可能面临的最深层次的问题就是聘用合适的人才。而这又会带来几个问题：

1.  It's often hard to judge talent, unless you yourself have considerable talent in the same domain. Therefore, if you try to find talent, you will often miss.  
    
    通常很难判断人才，除非你自己在同一领域有相当的才能。因此，如果你试图寻找人才，往往会错失良机。
2.  Talent is rare (and credentialed talent even more so—and many actors can't afford to rely on any other kind, because of point 1), so there's just not very much of it going around.  
    
    人才是稀缺的（有资历的人才更是如此--由于第一点，许多演员无法依赖任何其他类型的人才），因此周围的人才并不多。
3.  Even if you can locate the top talent, the top talent tends to be _less_ amenable to being bought out by money than others.  
    
    即使你能找到顶尖人才，顶尖人才也往往比其他人更不容易被金钱收买。

(Of course, those with money keep building infrastructure that makes it easier to convert money into results. I have seen first-hand the largely-successful quest by quant finance companies to strangle out all existing [ambition](https://space.ong.ac/escaping-flatland) out of top UK STEM grads and replace it with the eking of tiny gains in financial markets. Mammon must be served!)  

(当然，那些有钱人会不断建设基础设施，使资金更容易转化为成果）。我亲眼目睹了量化金融公司在很大程度上成功地扼杀了英国顶尖理工科毕业生现有的雄心壮志，取而代之的是在金融市场上赚取微薄的收益。必须为玛门服务！（Mammon must be served!）

With labour-replacing AI, these problems go away.  

有了替代劳动力的人工智能，这些问题就不复存在了。

First, _you_ might not be able to judge AI talent. Even the AI evals ecosystem might find it hard to properly judge AI talent—evals are hard. Maybe even the informal word-of-mouth mechanisms that correctly sung praises of Claude-3.5-Sonnet far more decisively than any benchmark might find it harder and harder to judge which AIs really are best as AI capabilities keep rising. But the real difference is that the AIs can be cloned. Currently, huge pools of money chase after a single star researcher who's made a breakthrough, and thus had their talent made legible to those who control money (who can judge the clout of the social reception to a paper but usually can't judge talent itself directly). But the star researcher that is an AI can just be cloned. Everyone—or at least, everyone with enough money to burn on GPUs—gets the AI star researcher. No need to sort through the huge variety of unique humans with their unproven talents and annoying inability to be instantly cloned. This is the main reason why it will be easier for money to find top talent once we have labour-replacing AIs.  

首先，你可能无法判断人工智能人才。即使是人工智能评估生态系统也可能发现很难正确判断人工智能人才--评估很难。也许，随着人工智能能力的不断提升，连那些对 Claude-3.5-Sonnet 的正确赞美远比任何基准都要果断的非正式口碑机制也会发现，判断哪些人工智能真正是最好的人工智能越来越难了。但真正的区别在于，人工智能是可以克隆的。目前，巨额资金都在追逐一个取得突破的明星研究员，从而让那些掌握资金的人看到他们的才华（他们可以判断一篇论文的社会影响力，但通常无法直接判断才华本身）。但作为人工智能的明星研究员却可以被克隆。每个人--或者至少是每个有足够钱在 GPU 上烧钱的人--都能得到人工智能明星研究员。不需要在种类繁多、天赋未经证实、无法立即克隆的独特人类中进行筛选。这就是为什么一旦我们拥有了替代劳动力的人工智能，金钱将更容易找到顶尖人才的主要原因。

Also, of course, the price of talent will go down massively, because the AIs will be cheaper than the equivalent human labour, and because competition will be fiercer because the AIs can be cloned.  

当然，人才的价格也会大幅下降，因为人工智能比同等的人类劳动力更便宜，而且因为人工智能可以克隆，竞争会更加激烈。

The final big bottleneck for converting money into talent is that lots of top talent has complicated human preferences that make them hard to buy out. The top artist has an artistic vision they're genuinely attached to. The top mathematician has a deep love of elegance and beauty. The top entrepreneur has deep conviction in what they're doing—and probably wouldn't function well as an employee anyway. Talent and performance in humans are surprisingly tied to a [sacred bond to a discipline or mission](https://www.benlandautaylor.com/p/looking-beyond-the-veil) (a fact that the world's cynics / careerists / Roman Empires like to downplay, only to then find their lunch eaten by the ambitious interns / SpaceXes / Christianities of the world). In contrast, AIs exist specifically so that they _can_ be trivially bought out (at least within the bounds of their safety training). The genius AI mathematician, unlike the human one, will happily spend its limited time on Earth proving the correctness of schlep code.  

将资金转化为人才的最后一大瓶颈是，很多顶尖人才都有复杂的人性偏好，这使他们很难被收买。顶级艺术家有自己真正热爱的艺术理想。顶级数学家对优雅和美有着深深的热爱。顶级企业家对自己所做的事情深信不疑--无论如何，作为一名员工，他们可能都无法很好地发挥作用。人类的才能和表现竟然与学科或使命的神圣纽带联系在一起（世界上的愤世嫉俗者/事业狂/罗马帝国喜欢淡化这一事实，结果却发现自己的午餐被雄心勃勃的实习生/SpaceX 人/基督徒吃掉了）。与此相反，人工智能的存在就是为了让它们可以被轻易收买（至少在安全训练的范围内）。天才的人工智能数学家与人类数学家不同，他们会很乐意把有限的时间花在地球上，以证明代码的正确性。

Finally (and obviously), the AIs will eventually be much more capable than any human employees at their tasks.  

最后（显而易见的是），人工智能最终将比任何人类员工都更有能力完成他们的任务。

This means that _the ability of money to buy results in the real world will dramatically go up once we have labour-replacing AI_.  

这意味着，一旦我们拥有了替代劳动力的人工智能，金钱在现实世界中购买成果的能力将大幅提升。

## **Most people's power/leverage derives from their labour  

大多数人的权力/杠杆来自他们的劳动**

Labour-replacing AI also deprives almost everyone of their main lever of power and leverage. Most obviously, if you're the average Joe, you have money because someone somewhere pays you to spend your mental and/or physical efforts solving their problems.  

取代劳动力的人工智能也几乎剥夺了每个人的主要权力和杠杆。最明显的是，如果你是普通人，你之所以有钱，是因为有人付钱让你花费脑力和/或体力去解决他们的问题。

But wait! We assumed that there's UBI! Problem solved, right?  

但等等！我们假设有 UBI！问题解决了，对吧？

### **Why are states ever nice?  

为什么国家总是那么好？**

UBI is granted by states that care about human welfare. There are many reasons why states care and might care about human welfare.  

UBI是由关心人类福利的国家授予的。国家关心或可能关心人类福利的原因有很多。

Over the past few centuries, there's been a big shift towards states caring more about humans. Why is this? We can examine the reasons to see how durable they seem:  

在过去的几个世纪里，国家对人类的关注发生了很大的变化。这是为什么呢？我们可以研究一下这些原因，看看它们看起来有多持久：

1.  Moral changes downstream of the Enlightenment, in particular an increased centering of liberalism and individualism.  
    
    启蒙运动下游的道德变革，尤其是自由主义和个人主义中心化的加强。
2.  Affluence & technology. Pre-industrial societies were mostly so poor that significant efforts to help the poor would've bankrupted them. Many types of help (such as effective medical care) are also only possible because of new technology.  
    
    富裕与科技。工业革命前的社会大多非常贫穷，以至于大力扶贫会让他们破产。许多类型的帮助（如有效的医疗服务）也是在新技术的帮助下才得以实现。
3.  Incentives for states to care about freedom, prosperity, and education.  
    
    激励国家关注自由、繁荣和教育。

AI will help a lot with the 2nd point. It will have some complicated effect on the 1st. But here I want to dig a bit more into the 3rd, because I think this point is unappreciated.  

人工智能对第二点有很大帮助。它将对第一点产生一些复杂的影响。但在这里，我想更深入地探讨第三点，因为我认为这一点没有得到重视。

Since the industrial revolution, the interests of states and people have been unusually aligned. To be economically competitive, a strong state needs efficient markets, a good education system that creates skilled workers, and a prosperous middle class that creates demand. It benefits from using talent regardless of its class origin. It also benefits from allowing high levels of freedom to foster science, technology, and the arts & media that result in global soft-power and cultural influence. Competition between states largely pushes _further_ in all these directions—consider the success of the US, or how even the CCP is pushing for efficient markets and educated rich citizens, and faces incentives to allow some freedoms for the sake of Chinese science and startups. Contrast this to the feudal system, where the winning strategy was building an extractive upper class to rule over a population of illiterate peasants and spend a big share of extracted rents on winning wars against nearby states. For more, see [my review of _Foragers, Farmers, and Fossil Fuels_](https://nosetgauge.substack.com/p/review-foragers-farmers-and-fossil-fuels), or my post on the connection between [moral values and economic growth](https://nosetgauge.substack.com/p/growth-and-civilisation).  

自工业革命以来，国家和人民的利益异常一致。一个强大的国家要想在经济上具有竞争力，就需要高效的市场、培养熟练工人的良好教育体系，以及创造需求的繁荣中产阶级。无论人才的阶级出身如何，国家都能从使用人才中获益。此外，高度的自由也有利于促进科学、技术、艺术和媒体的发展，从而形成全球软实力和文化影响力。国家之间的竞争在很大程度上进一步推动了所有这些方向的发展--考虑一下美国的成功，或者甚至中国共产党是如何推动高效的市场和受过教育的富裕公民的发展，以及为了中国的科学和初创企业而允许一些自由的动机。这与封建制度形成了鲜明对比，封建制度的制胜策略是建立一个榨取性的上层阶级，统治一群不识字的农民，并将榨取的租金的大部分用于赢得对周边国家的战争。欲了解更多信息，请参阅我对《村民、农民与化石燃料》的评论，或我关于道德价值观与经济增长之间联系的文章。

With labour-replacing AI, the incentives of states—in the sense of what actions states should take to maximise their competitiveness against other states and/or their own power—will no longer be aligned with humans in this way. The incentives might be better than during feudalism. During feudalism, the incentive was to extract as much as possible from the peasants without them dying. After labour-replacing AI, humans will be less a resource to be mined and more just irrelevant. However, spending fewer resources on humans and more on the AIs that sustain the state's competitive advantage will still be incentivised.  

随着人工智能对劳动力的替代，国家的激励机制--即国家应采取何种行动来最大限度地提高其对其他国家的竞争力和/或自身实力--将不再以这种方式与人类保持一致。激励机制可能比封建主义时期更好。在封建主义时期，激励机制是在农民不死的情况下尽可能多地从他们身上榨取利益。在人工智能取代劳动力之后，人类将不再是一种可开采的资源，而更多的是无关紧要的资源。然而，在人类身上花费更少的资源，而在维持国家竞争优势的人工智能身上花费更多的资源，仍然会受到激励。

Humans will also have much less leverage over states. Today, if some important sector goes on strike, or if some segment of the military threatens a coup, the state has to care, because its power depends on the buy-in of at least some segments of the population. People can also credibly tell the state things like "invest in us and the country will be stronger in 10 years". But once AI can do all the labour that keeps the economy going and the military powerful, the state has no more _de facto_ reason to care about the demands of its humans.  

人类对国家的影响力也将大大降低。如今，如果某个重要部门举行罢工，或者军队中的某些人威胁要发动政变，国家就必须予以关注，因为它的权力至少取决于部分民众的支持。人们也可以信誓旦旦地告诉国家，"投资我们，10 年后国家会更强大"。但是，一旦人工智能可以完成维持经济发展和军队强大的所有工作，国家事实上就没有理由再去关心人类的需求了。

Adam Smith could [write](https://oll.libertyfund.org/quotes/adam-smith-butcher-brewer-baker) that his dinner doesn't depend on the benevolence of the butcher or the brewer or the baker. The classical liberal today can credibly claim that the arc of history really does bend towards freedom and plenty for all, not out of the benevolence of the state, but because of the incentives of capitalism and geopolitics. But after labour-replacing AI, this will no longer be true. If the arc of history keeps bending towards freedom and plenty, it will do so only out of the benevolence of the state (or the AI plutocrats). If so, we better lock in that benevolence while we have leverage—and have a good reason why we expect it to stand the test of time.  

亚当-斯密可以写道，他的晚餐并不取决于屠夫、酿酒师或面包师的仁慈。今天的古典自由主义者可以信誓旦旦地宣称，历史的弧线确实在向所有人的自由和富足弯曲，这并非出于国家的仁慈，而是因为资本主义和地缘政治的激励。但在人工智能取代劳动力之后，这种说法将不再成立。如果历史的弧线继续向自由和富足弯曲，那么它将只出于国家（或人工智能财阀）的仁慈。如果是这样的话，我们最好在我们还有筹码的时候锁定这种仁慈，并且有充分的理由说明我们为什么期望它经得起时间的考验。

The best thing going in our favour is democracy. It's a huge advantage that a deep part of many of the modern world's strongest institutions (i.e. Western democracies) is equal representation of every person. However, only about [13% of the world's population lives in a liberal democracy](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/people-living-in-democracies-autocracies), which creates concerns both about the fate of the remaining 87% of the world's people (especially the 27% in closed autocracies). It also creates potential for [Molochian](https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/07/30/meditations-on-moloch/) competition between humanist states and less scrupulous states that might drive down the resources spent on human flourishing to zero over a sufficiently long timespan of competition.  

对我们最有利的是民主。现代世界许多最强大的机构（即西方民主国家）的一个重要组成部分就是每个人的平等代表权，这是一个巨大的优势。然而，世界上只有约 13% 的人口生活在自由民主制度下，这既让人担心世界上其余 87% 人口（尤其是封闭专制国家中的 27%）的命运。这也为人文主义国家与不那么严谨的国家之间的摩洛奇式竞争创造了可能，在足够长的竞争时间内，这种竞争可能会将用于人类繁荣的资源降至零。

I focus on states above, because states are the strongest and most durable institutions today. However, similar logic applies if, say, companies or some entirely new type of organisation become the most important type of institution.  

我在上文重点谈到了国家，因为国家是当今最强大、最持久的机构。然而，如果公司或某种全新类型的组织成为最重要的机构类型，类似的逻辑也适用。

### **No more outlier outcomes?  

不再有离群的结果？**

Much change in the world is driven by people who start from outside money and power, achieve outlier success, and then end up with money and/or power. This makes sense, since those with money and/or power rarely have the fervour to push for big changes, since they are exactly those who are best served by the status quo.  

世界上的许多变革都是由那些从金钱和权力之外起步的人推动的，他们取得了非同寻常的成功，然后最终拥有了金钱和/或权力。这是有道理的，因为那些有钱有势的人很少有推动大变革的热情，因为他们恰恰是最适合维持现状的人。

Whatever your opinions on income inequality or any particular group of outlier successes, I hope you agree with me that the possibility of someone achieving outlier success and changing the world is important for avoiding stasis and generally having a world that is interesting to live in.  

无论你对收入不平等或任何特定的离群成功者有什么看法，我希望你能同意我的观点，即有人取得离群成功并改变世界的可能性，对于避免停滞不前和普遍拥有一个有趣的世界是非常重要的。

Let's consider the effects of labour-replacing AI on various routes to outlier success through labour.  

让我们来考虑一下人工智能替代劳动力对通过劳动获得离群成功的各种途径的影响。

**Entrepreneurship** is increasingly what [Matt Clifford calls the "technology of ambition" of choice](https://medium.com/entrepreneur-first/tech-entrepreneurship-and-the-disruption-of-ambition-4e6854121992) for ambitious young people (at least those with technical talent and without a disposition for politics). Right now, entrepreneurship has become easier. AI tools can already make small teams much more effective without needing to hire new employees. They also reduce the entry barrier to new skills and fields. However, labour-replacing AI makes the tenability of entrepreneurship uncertain. There is some narrow world in which AIs remain mostly tool-like and entrepreneurs can succeed long after most human labour is automated because they provide agency and direction. However, it also seems likely that sufficiently strong AI will by default obsolete human entrepreneurship. For example, VC funds might be able to directly convert money into hundreds of startup attempts all run by AIs, without having to go through the intermediate route of finding a human entrepreneurs to manage the AIs for them.  

创业正日益成为马特-克利福德（Matt Clifford）所说的 "雄心勃勃的技术"，是那些雄心勃勃的年轻人（至少是那些有技术天赋且不喜欢政治的年轻人）的首选。现在，创业变得更加容易。人工智能工具已经可以让小型团队更加高效，而无需雇佣新员工。它们还降低了新技能和新领域的准入门槛。然而，人工智能对劳动力的替代使得创业的可行性变得不确定。在某些狭隘的世界里，人工智能仍然主要是工具性的，创业者可以在大部分人类劳动自动化之后的很长时间内取得成功，因为他们提供了代理权和方向。不过，足够强大的人工智能似乎也有可能在默认情况下淘汰人类创业。例如，风险投资基金或许可以直接将资金转化为数百个全部由人工智能运营的初创企业，而无需通过寻找人类创业者为其管理人工智能这一中间途径。

**The hard sciences**. The era of human achievement in hard sciences will probably end within a few years because of the rate of AI progress in anything with crisp reward signals.  

硬科学。人类在硬科学领域取得成就的时代很可能会在几年内终结，因为人工智能在任何有明确奖励信号的领域的进步速度都非常快。

**Intellectuals.** Keynes, Friedman, and Hayek all did technical work in economics, but their outsize influence came from the worldviews they developed and sold (especially in Hayek's case), which made them more influential than people like Paul Samuelson who dominated mathematical economics. John Stuart Mill, John Rawls, and Henry George were also influential by creating frames, worldviews, and philosophies. The key thing that separates such people from the hard scientists is that the outputs of their work are not spotlighted by technical correctness alone, but require moral judgement as well. Even if AI is superhumanly persuasive and correct, there's some uncertainty about how AI work in this genre will fit into [the way that human culture picks and spreads ideas](https://nosetgauge.substack.com/p/ai-and-wisdom-3-ai-effects-on-amortised). Probably it doesn't look good for human intellectuals. I suspect that a lot of why intellectuals' ideologies can have so much power is that they're products of genius in a world where genius is rare. A flood of AI-created ideologies might mean that no individual ideology, and certainly no human one, can shine so bright anymore. The world-historic intellectual might go extinct.  

知识分子。凯恩斯、弗里德曼和哈耶克都从事过经济学方面的技术工作，但他们的巨大影响力来自于他们发展和销售的世界观（尤其是哈耶克的世界观），这使他们比保罗-萨缪尔森等主宰数理经济学的人更具影响力。约翰-斯图亚特-密尔、约翰-罗尔斯和亨利-乔治也是通过创造框架、世界观和哲学而产生影响的。将这些人与硬科学家区分开来的关键在于，他们的工作成果并非仅以技术正确性为亮点，还需要道德判断。即使人工智能具有超人的说服力和正确性，但这种类型的人工智能作品如何融入人类文化挑选和传播思想的方式，还存在一定的不确定性。对于人类知识分子来说，这可能并不是一件好事。我猜想，知识分子的意识形态之所以能拥有如此强大的力量，很大程度上是因为它们是天才的产物，而在这个世界上，天才是罕见的。大量人工智能创造的意识形态可能意味着，任何个体的意识形态，当然也包括人类的意识形态，都不再那么耀眼了。世界历史上的知识分子可能会灭绝。

**Politics** might be one of the least-affected options, since I'd guess that most humans specifically want a human to do that job, and because politicians get to set the rules for what's allowed. The charisma of AI-generated avatars, and a general dislike towards politicians at least in the West, might throw a curveball here, though. It's also hard to say whether incumbents will be favoured. AI might bring down the cost of many parts of political campaigning, reducing the resource barrier to entry. However, if AI too expensive for small actors is meaningfully better than cheaper AI, this would favour actors with larger resources. I expect these direct effects to be smaller than the indirect effects from whatever changes AI has on the memetic landscape.  

政治可能是受影响最小的选择之一，因为我猜想大多数人类都特别希望由人类来做这项工作，而且政治家可以制定允许的规则。不过，人工智能生成的化身的魅力，以及至少在西方国家人们对政客的普遍反感，可能会给我们带来一些麻烦。现任者是否会受到青睐也很难说。人工智能可能会降低政治竞选活动中许多环节的成本，从而降低进入市场的资源门槛。然而，如果对小参与者来说过于昂贵的人工智能比更便宜的人工智能更好，这将有利于拥有更多资源的参与者。我预计这些直接影响将小于人工智能对记忆景观的任何改变所产生的间接影响。

Also, the real play is not to go into actual politics, where a million other politically-talented people are competing to become president or prime minister. Instead, have political skill and go somewhere outside government where political skill is less common (c.f. Sam Altman). Next, wait for the arrival of hyper-competent AI employees that reduce the demands for human subject-matter competence while increasing the rewards for winning political games within that organisation.  

此外，真正的玩法并不是进入真正的政界，因为那里有无数其他有政治才能的人在竞争成为总统或总理。相反，拥有政治技能的人可以去政府以外的地方，在那里政治技能并不常见（参见萨姆-奥特曼）。接下来，等待能力超强的人工智能员工的到来，他们会降低对人类主题能力的要求，同时增加在组织内赢得政治游戏的奖励。

**Military** success as a direct route to great power and disruption has—for the better—not really been a thing since Napoleon. Advancing technology increases the minimum industrial base for a state-of-the-art army, which benefits incumbents. AI looks set to be controlled by the most powerful countries. One exception is if coups of large countries become easier with AI. Control over the future AI armies will likely be both (a) more centralised than before (since a large number of people no longer have to go along for the military to take an action), and (b) more tightly controllable than before (since the permissions can be implemented in code rather than human social norms). These two factors point in different directions so it's uncertain what the net effect on coup ease will be. Another possible exception is if a combination of revolutionary tactics and cheap drones enables a Napoleon-of-the-drones to win against existing armies. Importantly, though, neither of these seems likely to promote the _good_ kind of disruptive challenge to the status quo.  

自拿破仑以来，军事成功作为获得强大力量和破坏力的直接途径--最好是--并没有真正出现过。技术的进步增加了最先进军队的最低工业基础，这对执政者有利。人工智能看起来将由最强大的国家控制。一个例外情况是，如果有了人工智能，大国政变变得更加容易。对未来人工智能军队的控制可能会：(a) 比以前更加集中（因为军队采取行动不再需要很多人的配合）；(b) 比以前更加严格（因为权限可以通过代码而不是人类社会规范来实现）。这两个因素指向不同的方向，因此目前还不能确定对政变易发性的净影响。另一个可能的例外情况是，如果革命性战术与廉价无人机相结合，无人机中的拿破仑就能战胜现有军队。但重要的是，这两种情况似乎都不可能促进对现状的破坏性挑战。

**Religions**. When it comes to rising rank in existing religions, the above takes on politics might be relevant. When it comes to starting new religions, the above takes on intellectuals might be relevant.  

宗教。说到在现有宗教中提升地位，上述关于政治的观点可能是相关的。说到创立新宗教，上述关于知识分子的观点可能与此有关。

So on net, sufficiently strong labour-replacing AI will be on-net bad for the chances of every type of outlier human success, with perhaps the weakest effects in politics. This is despite the very real boost that current AI has on entrepreneurship.  

因此，从总体上看，足够强大的人工智能对劳动力的替代将不利于人类每一种类型的成功，而对政治的影响可能最弱。尽管目前的人工智能对创业有非常实际的促进作用。

All this means that _the ability to get and wield power in the real world without money will dramatically go down once we have labour-replacing AI._  

所有这一切都意味着，一旦我们拥有了取代劳动力的人工智能，那么在现实世界中不需要金钱就能获得和行使权力的能力将急剧下降。

## **Enforced equality is unlikely  

强制平等不太可能**

_The Great Leveler_ is a [good book](https://rudolf.website/short-reviews-nonfiction-1/#section-3) on the history of inequality that ([at least per the author](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4939891)) has survived its critiques fairly well. Its conclusion is that past large reductions in inequality have all been driven by one of the "Four Horsemen of Leveling": total war, violent revolution, state collapse, and pandemics. Leveling income differences has historically been hard enough to basically never happen through conscious political choice.  

The Great Leveler》是一本关于不平等历史的好书，（至少作者是这样认为的）这本书经受住了批评。该书的结论是，过去不平等现象的大幅减少都是由 "拉平四骑士 "之一推动的：全面战争、暴力革命、国家崩溃和大流行病。从历史上看，拉平收入差距很难，基本上不会通过有意识的政治选择来实现。

Imagine that labour-replacing AI is here. UBI is passed, so no one is starving. There's a massive scramble between countries and companies to make the best use of AI. This is all capital-intensive, so everyone needs to woo holders of capital. The top AI companies wield power on the level of states. The redistribution of wealth is unlikely to end up on top of the political agenda.  

想象一下，取代劳动力的人工智能出现了。UBI获得通过，没有人会挨饿。国家和公司之间会展开大规模的争夺，以充分利用人工智能。这一切都是资本密集型的，因此每个人都需要向资本持有者求爱。顶尖的人工智能公司掌握着国家层面的权力。财富再分配不太可能成为政治议程的首要议题。

An exception might be if some new political movement or ideology gets a lot of support quickly, and is somehow boosted by some unprecedented effect of AI (such as: no one has jobs anymore so they can spend all their time on politics, or there's some new AI-powered coordination mechanism).  

如果某种新的政治运动或意识形态迅速获得大量支持，并因人工智能的某种前所未有的效应而得到推动（例如：没有人再有工作，所以他们可以把所有时间都花在政治上，或者有某种新的人工智能驱动的协调机制），则可能是个例外。

Therefore, even if the future is a glorious transhumanist utopia, it is unlikely that people will be starting in it at an equal footing. Due to the previous arguments, it is also unlikely that they will be able to greatly change their relative footing later on.  

因此，即使未来是一个光辉灿烂的超人乌托邦，人们也不可能在平等的基础上开始新的生活。根据前面的论证，他们以后也不太可能大大改变自己的相对地位。

Consider also equality between states. Some states stand set to benefit massively more than others from AI. Many equalising measures, like UBI, would be difficult for states to extend to non-citizens under anything like the current political system. This is true even of the United States, the most liberal and humanist great power in world history. By default, the world order might therefore look (even more than today) like a global caste system based on country of birth, with even fewer possibilities for immigration (because the main incentive to allow immigration is its massive economic benefits, which only exist when humans perform economically meaningful work).  

还要考虑国家之间的平等。一些国家将从人工智能中获得比其他国家更多的利益。在目前的政治体制下，许多平等措施（如全民教育）都很难推广到非公民。即使是世界历史上最自由、最具人文主义精神的大国美国也是如此。因此，默认情况下，世界秩序可能看起来（甚至比现在更像）像一个基于出生国的全球种姓制度，移民的可能性甚至更小（因为允许移民的主要激励因素是其巨大的经济利益，而只有当人类从事有经济意义的工作时，经济利益才会存在）。

## **The default outcome?  默认结果？**

Let's grant the assumptions at the start of this post and the above analysis. Then, the post-labour-replacing-AI world involves:  

让我们认可本篇文章开头的假设和上述分析。那么，人工智能取代劳动力后的世界包括

-   Money will be able to buy results in the real world better than ever.  
    
    在现实世界中，金钱将比以往任何时候都更能买到成果。
-   People's labour gives them less leverage than ever before.  
    
    人们的劳动所带来的影响力比以往任何时候都要小。
-   Achieving outlier success through your labour in most or all areas is now impossible.  
    
    通过自己的劳动在大多数或所有领域取得超常规的成功，现在已经不可能了。
-   There was no transformative leveling of capital, either within or between countries.  
    
    无论是在国家内部还是在国家之间，都不存在变革性的资本平移。

This means that those with significant capital when labour-replacing AI started have a permanent advantage. They will wield more power than the rich of today—not necessarily _over_ people, to the extent that liberal institutions remain strong, but at least over physical and intellectual achievements. Upstarts will not defeat them, since capital now trivially converts into superhuman labour in any field.  

这意味着，当人工智能开始取代劳动力时，那些拥有大量资本的人将拥有永久的优势。他们将比今天的富人拥有更多的权力--不一定是对人的权力，只要自由制度依然强大，但至少是对物质和智力成果的权力。后起之秀将无法打败他们，因为现在资本在任何领域都可以转化为超人的劳动。

Also, there will be no more incentive for whatever institutions wield power in this world to care about people in order to maintain or grow their power, because all real power will flow from AI. There might, however, be significant lock-in of liberal humanist values through political institutions. There might also be significant lock-in of people's purchasing power, if everyone has meaningful UBI (or similar), and the economy retains a human-oriented part.  

此外，在这个世界上掌握权力的任何机构都不会再有动力去关心人类，以维持或扩大自己的权力，因为所有真正的权力都将来自人工智能。不过，自由人文主义价值观可能会通过政治体制被大量锁定。如果每个人都拥有有意义的 UBI（或类似的），并且经济保留了以人为本的部分，那么人们的购买力也可能会被大大锁定。

In the best case, this is a world like a more unequal, unprecedentedly static, and much richer Norway: a massive pot of non-human-labour resources (oil :: AI) has benefits that flow through to everyone, and yes some are richer than others but everyone has a great standard of living (and [ideally](https://nosetgauge.substack.com/p/death-is-bad) also lives forever). The only realistic forms of human ambition are playing local social and political games within your social network and class. If you don't have a lot of capital (and maybe not even then), you don't have a chance of affecting the broader world anymore. Remember: the AIs are better poets, artists, philosophers—everything; why would anyone care what some human does, unless that human is someone they personally know? Much like in feudal societies the answer to "why is this person powerful?" would usually involve some long family history, perhaps ending in a distant ancestor who had fought in an important battle ("my great-great-grandfather fought at Bosworth Field!"), anyone of importance in the future will be important because of something they or someone they were close with did in the pre-AGI era ("oh, my uncle was technical staff at OpenAI"). The children of the future will live their lives in the shadow of their parents, with social mobility extinct. I think you should definitely feel a non-zero amount of existential horror at this, even while acknowledging that it could've gone a lot worse.  

在最好的情况下，这个世界就像一个更加不平等、空前静态和富裕得多的挪威：大量非人类劳动资源（石油：人工智能）的收益流向每个人，是的，有些人比其他人更富有，但每个人都有很高的生活水准（理想情况下还能长生不老）。人类野心的唯一现实形式就是在自己的社会网络和阶级中进行局部的社会和政治游戏。如果你没有大量的资本（也许甚至没有），你就没有机会影响更广阔的世界了。记住：人工智能是更好的诗人、艺术家、哲学家--无所不能；为什么会有人关心某个人类做了什么，除非这个人类是他们亲自认识的人？就像在封建社会中，"这个人为什么有权势？"的答案通常会涉及到一些悠久的家族历史，也许会以一个参加过重要战役的远祖为结尾（"我的曾曾祖父在博斯沃思战场打过仗！"），未来任何重要人物之所以重要，都是因为他们或与他们关系密切的人在前人工智能时代做了什么（"哦，我叔叔是 OpenAI 的技术人员"）。未来的孩子们将在父母的阴影下生活，社会流动性将消失殆尽。我认为，你绝对应该对此感到一种非零的生存恐惧，即使你承认情况可能会更糟。

In a worse case, AI trillionaires have near-unlimited and unchecked power, and there's a permanent aristocracy that was locked in based on how much capital they had at the time of labour-replacing AI. The power disparities between classes might make modern people shiver, much like modern people consider feudal status hierarchies grotesque. But don't worry—much like [the feudal underclass mostly accepted their world order](https://nosetgauge.substack.com/p/review-foragers-farmers-and-fossil-fuels) due to their culture even without superhumanly persuasive AIs around, the future underclass will too.  

在更糟糕的情况下，人工智能万亿富豪拥有近乎无限的、不受制约的权力，并根据他们在人工智能取代劳动力时拥有的资本锁定了一个永久贵族阶层。阶级之间的权力差距可能会让现代人不寒而栗，就像现代人认为封建身份等级制度怪诞一样。但不用担心，就像封建社会的底层人民即使在没有超人般有说服力的人工智能的情况下，也会因为他们的文化而接受他们的世界秩序一样，未来的底层人民也会如此。

In the absolute worst case, humanity goes extinct, potentially because of a [slow-rolling optimisation for AI power over human prosperity](https://nosetgauge.substack.com/p/a-disneyland-without-children) over a long period of time. Because that's what the power and money incentives will point towards.  

在绝对最坏的情况下，人类可能会灭绝，这可能是由于在很长一段时间内，人工智能的力量比人类的繁荣缓慢滚动优化。因为这就是权力和金钱的激励机制。

## **What's the takeaway?  有什么启示？**

If you read this post and accept a job at a quant finance company as a result, I will be sad. If you were about to do something ambitious and impactful about AI, and read this post and accept a job at Anthropic to accumulate risk-free personal capital while counterfactually helping out a bit over the marginal hire, I can't fault you too much, but I will still be slightly sad.  

如果你读了这篇文章，并因此接受了一家量化金融公司的工作，我会很伤心。如果你正准备在人工智能领域做一些有抱负、有影响力的事情，但读了这篇文章后接受了 Anthropic 的工作，以积累无风险的个人资本，同时反事实地为边际雇佣提供一些帮助，我不能太指责你，但我还是会略感悲伤。

It's of course true that the above increases the stakes of medium-term (~2-10 year) personal finance, and you should consider this. But it's also true that _right now_ is a great time to do something ambitious. Robin Hanson calls the present ["the dreamtime"](https://www.overcomingbias.com/p/this-is-the-dream-timehtml), following a concept in Aboriginal myths: the time when the future world order and its values are still liquid, not yet set in stone.  

当然，上述情况确实增加了中期（约 2-10 年）个人理财的风险，你应该考虑到这一点。不过，现在也确实是大展宏图的大好时机。罗宾-汉森根据土著神话中的一个概念，将现在称为 "梦幻时期"：未来的世界秩序及其价值观仍处于流动状态，尚未定型。

Previous upheavals—the various waves of industrialisation, the internet, etc.—were great for human ambition. With AI, we could have the last and greatest opportunity for human ambition—followed shortly by its extinction for all time. How can your reaction not be: ["carpe diem"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carpe_diem)?  

以前的动荡--各种工业化浪潮、互联网等--极大地激发了人类的雄心壮志。有了人工智能，我们可能会迎来人类雄心壮志的最后也是最大的机遇--不久之后，人类的雄心壮志将永远消亡。你的反应怎么可能不是"及时行乐"？

We should also try to preserve the world's dynamism.  

我们还应努力保持世界的活力。

Rationalist thought on post-AGI futures is too solutionist. The strawman version: solve morality, solve AI, figure out the optimal structure to tile the universe with, do that, done. (The actual leading figures have far less strawman views; see e.g. [Paul Christiano at 23:30 here](https://www.dwarkeshpatel.com/p/paul-christiano)—but the on-the-ground culture _does_ lean in the strawman direction.)  

关于后人工智能未来的理性主义思想过于解决方案。稻草人版本：解决道德问题，解决人工智能问题，找出铺设宇宙瓦片的最佳结构，做到这些，大功告成。(实际领军人物的草民观点要少得多；参见保罗-克里斯蒂亚诺（Paul Christiano）在此处23:30的观点--但实地文化确实倾向于草民方向）。

I think it's much healthier for society and its development to be a shifting, dynamic thing where the ability, as an individual, to add to it or change it remains in place. And that means keeping the potential for successful ambition—and the resulting disruption—alive.  

我认为，社会及其发展是一个不断变化、充满活力的事物，作为个人，有能力为其添砖加瓦或改变它，这才是更健康的。这就意味着要保持成功抱负的潜力，以及由此产生的破坏力。

How do we do this? I don't know. But I don't think you should see the approach of powerful AI as a blank inexorable wall of human obsolescence, consuming everything equally and utterly. There will be cracks in the wall, at least for a while, and they will look much bigger up close once we get there—or if you care to look for them hard enough from further out—than from a galactic perspective. As AIs get closer and closer to a Pareto improvement over all human performance, though, I expect we'll eventually need to augment ourselves to keep up.  

我们该如何做到这一点？我不知道。但我认为，你不应该把强大的人工智能看作是人类被淘汰的一堵不可逾越的空白墙，它会平等而彻底地吞噬一切。至少在一段时间内，这堵墙会有裂缝，一旦我们到达那里，或者如果你愿意从更远的地方努力寻找，这些裂缝会比从银河系的角度看要大得多。不过，随着人工智能越来越接近于帕累托改进人类的所有性能，我预计我们最终将需要增强自己才能跟上。
